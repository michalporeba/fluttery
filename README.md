# fluttery

This repository represents my attempt at learning [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/). 

It contains a number of sample applications built while following articles, books and tutorials. Each demonstrates a skill learnt. 
I will keep the examples with my comments here, publicly available, so I can easily come back to them when I inevitably forget things. 

# Contents

1. [Hello World](./hello/) - A variation of the classic first application in any language. 
2. [Startup Namer](./startup_namer/) - An introduction to flutter from Google I/O 2021.
3. [Unit Converter](./unit_converter/) - A simple unit converter. 
4. [Timer](./timer/) - Timer example - two pages. Caused issues with CocoaPods. *(For now I am giving up, as it is not time to wrestle with stuff like that)*.
5. [State](./state/) - A group of solutions experimenting with state management approaches. It is based, and has been inspired on Google I/O 2019 demo - Pragmatic State Management in Flutter. 
6. [Fizz Buzz] - a stream implementation of a classic fizz buzz problem.
