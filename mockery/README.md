# Mockery

A Flutter package to help me create mock user experiences to kick start discussion about what is possible, and quickly test apetite for ideas. 

## Features

* Pretend sign-in page

## Getting started

At the moment the package is not published, so the recommended way to use it is by http import. 

```dart
import 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michalporeba/fluttery/main/mockery/lib/mockery.dart';
```

## Usage

Examples will be in the `/example` folder.
